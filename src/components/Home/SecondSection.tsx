            We present an intergalactic game where the ships are NFTs. By
            acquiring one, you start exciting matches. Pay attention to your
            playing time, as your power or life can be modified, allowing you to
            accumulate more points.
            <br />
            <br />
            The more points you have, the more benefits you will receive and the
            greater your chances of victory. The winner, in addition to taking
            the opponent's score, gets 80% of the value bet on the game. The
            remaining 20% are distributed to your future, with part of the value
            being invested in various networks using cross-chain technology.

            HYPNOS arises with the aim of expanding the use and benefits of
            web3, providing usability and abstraction. In addition, we want
            people to invest in DeFi without the need to understand the
            technology behind it.

            <br />
            We use DataFeed to monitor the price of on-chain assets and make
            purchases and sales according to the pool accumulated by each user
            in the victories achieved.
